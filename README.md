This repo is forked from `ketcomp`'s original repo called [learnnode](https://github.com/Ketcomp/learnnode). The content has been modified to suit the needs of the CS Outreach camps on NodeJs and keeping in mind the age-group that will use this resource, everything right from installation of NodeJs is covered here.

Node.js, a revolutionary technology, is the immediate and near future of modern web application development with JavaScript as the sole server-side language. 

##### Why Learn Node.js
JavaScript is the language of the web today and unquestionably for the near future because there is no known alternative to JavaScript in the works. The ECMAScript organization has been moving full pace ahead with advancing the JavaScript language.

With a solid understanding of Node.js, you will be able to use JavaScript to develop real-time, fast, scalable, data-driven web applications, and you will have the requisite knowledge to quickly adapt to any of the emerging, cutting-edge JavaScript technologies like Derby.js and Meteor.js.
